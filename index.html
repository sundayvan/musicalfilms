  <h2>I love musical movies!</h2>
  Musical film is a film genre in which songs by the characters are interwoven into the narrative, sometimes accompanied by dancing.

  The songs usually advance the plot or develop the film's characters, but in some cases, they serve merely as breaks in the storyline, often as elaborate "production numbers."

  The musical film was a natural development of the stage musical after the emergence of sound film technology. Typically, the biggest difference between film and stage musicals is the use of lavish background scenery and locations that would be
  impractical in a theater. Musical films characteristically contain elements reminiscent of theater; performers often treat their song and dance numbers as if a live audience were watching. In a sense, the viewer becomes the diegetic audience, as
  the performer looks directly into the camera and performs to it.
