  <h2>Chicago</h2>

  <strong>Chicago</strong> is a 2002 American musical black comedy crime film based on the 1975 stage musical of the same name. It explores the themes of celebrity, scandal, and corruption in Chicago during the Jazz Age. The film stars Ren√©e
  Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Richard Gere. Chicago centers on Roxie Hart (Zellweger) and Velma Kelly (Zeta-Jones) two murderesses who find themselves in jail together awaiting trial in 1920s Chicago. Roxie, a housewife, and Velma, a
  vaudevillian, fight for the fame that will keep them from the gallows. <p><img src="chicago.jpg" width="50%"></P>

    2003, including Best Picture, the first musical to win Best Picture since Oliver! in 1968.
